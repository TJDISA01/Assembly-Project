My work using NASM Assembly through Linux Ubuntu, following tutorials by Exercism
```
Hello_World.asm	- My version of Hello World, following a youtube tutorial linked in the file

Hello_World.o	- The NASM output of Hello_World.asm

Hello	- Run as "./Hello" to return the line "Hello, world!" in the shell

hello_world.asm	- Exercism's version

two_fer.asm - Returns "One for X, one for me." based on input name. Default X is "you".

codewars_if_function.asm - My solution to "The 'if' function" on Codewars, "https://www.codewars.com/kata/54147087d5c2ebe4f1000805/train/nasm"
